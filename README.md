# Quantium_SoftwareEngineer
I recently completed Quantium's Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I developed an interactive Dash application to help clients assess the impact of price changes on sales and profitability. I also implemented a test suite using Pytest, automated testing with Bash, and designed an intuitive UI with CSS.
