## Quantium Software Engineering Job Simulation

**Quantium_SoftwareEngineer:** <br>
I recently completed Quantium's Software Engineering job simulation on Forage, where I developed an interactive Dash application to help clients assess the impact of price changes on sales and profitability. I also implemented a test suite using Pytest, automated testing with Bash, and designed an intuitive UI with CSS.

**Repository Overview:**  
This repository documents my experience in the **Quantium Software Engineering Virtual Experience** on the Forage platform. The simulation allowed me to take on the role of a **software engineer** where I developed an interactive **Dash application** to help a client assess the impact of price changes on their sales and profitability. I also implemented a test suite to ensure the application’s functionality and created a user-friendly interface for an enhanced user experience.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Developing an Interactive Dash Application**  
   - Designed and developed a **Dash application** that enabled the client to assess the impact of price changes on sales and profitability. The application provided interactive features for data visualization and analysis.

2. **Implementing a Test Suite**  
   - Implemented a **test suite** using **Pytest** to verify the functionality of the Dash application, ensuring that it behaves as expected. Developed a **bash script** to automate the running of the test suite.

3. **Designing an Engaging User Interface**  
   - Focused on creating an **intuitive user interface (UI)** to ensure the client could easily interact with the application. Applied **CSS** to style the application and make it visually appealing and user-friendly.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **Dash Development**: Gained experience in developing interactive applications using **Dash** to visualize and analyze data in real-time.
- **Data Processing with Pandas**: Processed and cleaned data using **Pandas** to ensure the application displayed relevant and accurate information.
- **Testing with Pytest**: Applied **Pytest** for unit testing, ensuring that the application’s components function as intended.
- **Automation with Bash**: Automated the running of the test suite using **bash scripting**, streamlining the testing process.
- **Front-End Development**: Utilized **CSS** to design an engaging user interface that made interacting with the application enjoyable for the client.
- **Selenium for Testing**: Used **Selenium** to automate browser testing, ensuring the user interface was responsive and functional across different browsers.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Full-Stack Engineering**: Strengthened my ability to work across the full stack, from building back-end functionality with Dash to creating an engaging front-end interface.
- **Data Visualization**: Enhanced my skills in visualizing complex data and presenting it in an easily digestible format for decision-makers.
- **Software Testing and Automation**: Gained valuable experience in **unit testing**, **automation**, and writing **test scripts** for both back-end functionality and front-end usability.
- **UI/UX Design**: Improved my understanding of **user experience (UX)** design principles, ensuring that the application is not only functional but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.

**Objective:**  
This repository highlights the tasks and skills I developed during the **Quantium Software Engineering Job Simulation**. The experience solidified my passion for full-stack engineering, and I am eager to apply the knowledge I gained in real-world applications. I would love to leverage my experience in building interactive applications to help clients make better decisions through data analysis, just as I did during this simulation.
